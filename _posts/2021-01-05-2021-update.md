![](/images/summerside-community-choir-2020-covid.webp)We've decided to hold off on starting up again until we see how the year starts to take shape.

The executive will reassess the situation in early March to see whether we will have a delayed-start Spring 2021 term,  a Summer 2021 term, or just wait until September for our regular fall start.

In the mean time, we hope everyone stays happy and healthy, and look forward to singing with (and maybe for you??) again _sometime_ this year!
