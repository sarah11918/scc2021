In 1978, Bill Leuty had a dream to start a community choir in Summerside, PEI, Canada. After winning a wager with our soon-to-be first director that he could attract enough people in Summerside to start a choir, he was able to make this dream a reality. 

In 2018 the 50-plus member Summerside Community Choir celebrated forty years of choral music.
