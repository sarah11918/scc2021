In 1978, Bill Leuty had a dream to start a community choir in Summerside, PEI, Canada. After winning a wager with our soon-to-be first director that he could attract enough people in Summerside to start a choir, he was able to make this dream a reality. 

In 2018 the 50-plus member Summerside Community Choir celebrated forty years of choral music, thanks to Bill's determination and perseverance!

Bill continues to be an active supporter of the Summerside Community Choir, and regularly joins us for concerts on stage and at the ticket desk.
