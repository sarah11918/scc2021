The Summerside Community Choir is an open membership, mixed-voice community choir who welcomes new members at the beginning of each term to work towards an end-of-term concert. We perform two Christmas concerts in December and two spring concerts in May or June and may have extra events throughout the term.

In 1978, Bill Leuty had a dream to start a community choir in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada.  He was able to make this dream a reality, and in 2018 the 50-plus member Summerside Community Choir celebrated forty years of choral music on PEI.

The Summerside Community Choir sings under the direction of Dr. Margot Rejskind.
