We are an open membership (no audition required!), mixed-voice community choir who welcomes new (and returning!) members at the beginning of each term to work towards an end-of-term concert. We perform two Christmas concerts in December and two spring concerts in May or June and may have extra events throughout the term.

In 1978, Bill Leuty had a dream to start a community choir in Summerside, PEI, Canada.  He was able to make this dream a reality, and in 2013 the 70-plus member Summerside Community Choir celebrated thirty-five years of choral music.

In 2014, our 40-member choir celebrated the 150th anniversary of the 1864 Charlottetown Conference with an all-Canadian "Together In Song" Concert Tour across PEI.

The Summerside Community Choir sings under the direction of Dr. Margot Rejskind.
