# Annual Choral Events

Every year, members of the Summerside Community Choir attend events and workshops that are open to the public. Even if you can't commit to us for the whole choir term, contact us to attend with our group at:

* [New Brunswick Choral Fest](https://nbcfsite.wordpress.com/choral-fest/) (annually, in October) in rotating cities around New Brunswick
* [High Cs Choral Festival](https://www.highcs.org) (annually, Victoria Day weekend) in Digby, NS.

# Choral Workshops

Members of our group often travel around the Maritimes to participate in special workshops and educational events. You can check the [Summerside Choir's Google Calendar](https://summersidechoir.ca/calendar.html) to see which events are on our radar, and contact us if you'd like to join us.

# Concerts

Concerts of special interest to our members are also listed on our Google Calendar. We encourage you to support these artists and ensembles!
