# Annual Choral Events

Every year, members of the Summerside Community Choir attend events and workshops that are open to the public. Even if you can't join us for the whole choir term, contact us to participate with our group at:

* [New Brunswick Choral Fest](https://nbcfsite.wordpress.com/choral-fest/) (annually, in October) in rotating cities around New Brunswick
* [High Cs Choral Festival](https://www.highcs.org) (annually, Victoria Day weekend) in Digby, NS.

# Choral Workshops

Members of our group often travel around the Maritimes to participate in special workshops and educational events.
